# testForChatfuel
Test task for Chatfuel company.

# run app
npm run dev

# IMPORTANT NOTE

As soon as there was no back-end provided and I can't build real app I created prototype with Ajax requests you could see at console. But to make app as workable as possible there are test data stored at './vuex/modiles/users'. In case we have proper endpoinds response data should be stored at this module.

Unfortunately I do not have an option to detail some misunderstending I have about previousPageUrl and nextPageUrl purpose I've made an assumption that not all users stores and returns form one endpoint and this url should be concatenated with '/users' endpoint to get other users.
